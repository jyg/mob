Generating MobMuPlat interface files (.mmp) directly from *.pd patches

MobMuPlat (see http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/) is an app that lets you run pd patches on iOS / Android mobile devices.
In order to build guis, it comes with a java app that generates .mmp files.

[mob] lets you build those .mmp files directly from the patch you want to use on mobile platform.
