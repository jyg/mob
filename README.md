Generating MobMuPlat interface files (.mmp) directly from *.pd patches

MobMuPlat (see http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/) is an app that lets you run pd patches on iOS / Android mobile devices.
In order to create GUIs, it comes with a java app (MobMuPlat Editor) that generates .mmp files.

[mob] lets you build those .mmp files directly from the patch you want to use on mobile platform, without the need of using MobMuPlat Editor. What you get should be what you see !
